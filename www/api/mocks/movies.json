I Am Durán tells his story, inextricably interwoven with the story of the nation of Panama. As Roberto Durán rose, fell, and rose again, staggering between glory and disaster, buffeted by the brutal blows of his opponents and of life itself – so did his beloved Panama. A country brought to its knees as a pawn in violent regional and international politics and suffering from the harsh yoke of dictator Manuel Noriega's ruthless regime, in its darkest hour Panama needed a hero, a voice, and an identity. Roberto Durán's impact transcended boxing and politics. Born a fighter, his success inside the ring transformed him into an icon, yet it was his flaws and failures outside the ring that made him a hero and continue to ensure that his universal appeal and popularity endure to this day.",

That success earned him an immense fortune and worldwide fame. His was also one of the most influential and inspiring sports stories of recent memory and became a pop culture phenomenon, thanks to his Livestrong initiative. Beginning in 2009, Academy Award winning documentarian Alex Gibney followed Armstrong for four years chronicling his return to cycling after retirement, as he tried to win his eighth title. Unexpectedly, Gibney was also there in 2012 when Armstrong admitted to doping, following a federal criminal investigation, public accusations of doping by his ex-teammates, and an investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency, that led USADA's CEO, Travis Tygart, to conclude that Armstrong's team had run 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.",

He does well--so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler.

And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him.",
